# android-backup-broccoli
backup photos to github

# normal use


# features

* idempotent: after running once,
running again effectively does nothing
(until new photos are discovered on phone)
* incremental / interruptible:
the phone can be unplugged at any time,
and running it later
will be able to recover and resume.
* respectful: 
"We recommend repositories remain small,
ideally less than 1 GB, and
less than 5 GB is strongly recommended." and
"GitHub limits the size of files allowed in repositories. If you attempt to add or update a file that is larger than 50 MB, you will receive a warning from Git." --
